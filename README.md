\begin{abstract}
This study compares the performance of a basic matrix multiplication algorithm implemented in three programming languages: Python, Java, and C++. The goal is to analyze the efficiency of each language in terms of execution time, memory usage, and CPU utilization. Benchmarks were conducted on matrices of various sizes (64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024), revealing that C++ provides the best performance with significantly lower execution times compared to Python and Java. Particularly, for larger matrices, C++ demonstrated greater efficiency in both memory usage and execution times. The collected data also highlight the impact of language-specific features on performance. This work offers valuable insights for developers in choosing the most suitable programming language for intensive operations like matrix multiplication and suggests directions for further research in the field of algorithm optimization.

\section{Introduction / Background / Motivation}
Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in many fields of science and engineering, ranging from computer graphics to artificial intelligence. Various programming languages offer tools and libraries to perform this operation, but their performance can differ significantly based on implementation and the inherent characteristics of the language. This study aims to analyze the efficiency of three programming languages: Python, Java, and C++, focusing on key aspects such as execution time, memory usage, and CPU utilization. Existing literature highlights performance differences among languages, but lacks a systematic comparison based on empirical measurements. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by providing a detailed evaluation of each language's performance and offering insights for informed programming language choices.

\section{Problem Statement}
Matrix multiplication has a computational complexity of O(nÂ³), making it one of the most resource-intensive operations in terms of execution time. As the size of matrices increases, optimizing the implementation becomes crucial to ensure high performance. The central question of this study is: which programming language offers the best performance for the basic matrix multiplication algorithm, considering variables such as execution time, memory usage, and CPU utilization?

\section{Solution / Proposal / Methodology}
To address the problem, algorithms for matrix multiplication were implemented in Python, Java, and C++. The algorithms were tested on matrices of increasing sizes (64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512, and 1024x1024). The benchmarks were conducted on a test system with known hardware and software specifications, utilizing benchmarking tools to measure execution times, memory usage, and, optionally, CPU utilization. Each experiment was repeated multiple times to ensure the reliability of the results and minimize variability in the data.

\section{Experiments}
Experiments were conducted for each language, documenting the results in terms of execution time, memory usage, and CPU utilization. The collected data are presented below:
